                            If you have any symptoms of COVID-19, you should self-isolate and phone a GP immediately.

                            Other people in your household will need to restrict their movements too. Having a lots of
                            rest and sleep, drinking water enough, avoiding unhealthy habits and taking some medicines
                            usually help to cure the light symtoms at home.

                            you should book an appointment days before to make sure you will have the results on time.

                            This Pandemic is causing a difficult situation all around the world. Media can publish facts
                            with the sense of worry. To understand better what is going on is better to check the
                            statistics by yourself and make your own opinion. I provide you a link below to Worldometer
                            where you can check the number of active/new cases, deaths, recoveries for 1 Million of

                            properly. The Irish Government requieres a negative or 'not detected' PCR test within 72
                            hours and filling out the Passenger Locator Form from anyone arriving to the country.

                            Arriving without any evidence for not being infected can have serious consequences. After
                            your arrivar you must stay in mandatory quarantine during 14 days. Of course there are
                            exceptions as always (business trip, medical purpose, truck drivers etc.)
                            <br>
                            Also Ireland has a unique hotel quarantine system for travellers arriving from sertain
                            countries. It means you must have pre-payed and pre-booked accomodation for the next 14 days
                            after your arrival.

                        <p>
                            Pandemic can be worrying for many of us. This is a hard time for everyone getting used to a
                            new way of life. Some people can handle it easier but for those who are extrovert and can
                            not do any hobby they had before the Pandemic might cause a serious mental issue. To
                            avoiding it you should try new indoor activities and see the Pandemic from a different point
                            of view. Here I have some advices for you:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Keep doing your daily habits (included dressing up).</li>
                                <li>Doing exercises can keep not only physical but mental health too.</li>
                                <li>Set a limit to using social media and reading worrying news.</li>
                                <li>Keep in touch online with friends and communities you are part of.</li>
                                <li>In your extra free time start doing/learning something yoy always wanted.</li>
                                <li>Find relaxing habits.</li>
                            </ul>
                            In case you feel stressed, anxiety, useless, becoming irritable more easily, having sleeping
                            troubles, etc. you should get professional help.

                            Fortunatley the Covid vaccine is already invented and We have many different options to be
                            protected from serious symptons. There are a few suppliers such as Pfizer/BioNTech,
                            AstraZeneca etc. The vaccine is therefore a safe and clever way to produce an immune
                            response in the body, without causing illness. In Europe getting the Covid vaccine is not
                            obligatory but recommended. You can find all the information related with
                            Irish Vaccination (how can you get it, vaccination plan, statistics, public opinion etc.) in

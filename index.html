                            Arriving without any evidence for not being infected can have serious consequences. After

                            exceptions as always (business trip, medical purpose, truck drivers etc.)

                            Pandemic might cause a serious mental issue. To avoiding it you should try new indoor
                            activities and see the Pandemic from a different point of view. Here I have some advices for
                            you:

                                <li>Doing exercises can keep not only physical but mental health too.</li>

                            Fortunatley the Covid vaccine is already invented and We have many different options to be
                            protected from serious symptons. There are a few suppliers such as Pfizer/BioNTech,
                            AstraZeneca etc. The vaccine is therefore a safe and clever way to produce an immune
                            response in the body, without causing illness. In Europe getting the Covid vaccine is not
                            obligatory but recommended. You can find all the information related with
                            Irish Vaccination (how can you get it, vaccination plan, statistics, public opinion etc.) in

## **Goal for this project** 

Our life has changed quite a lot due to Coronavirus was spreaded all around the world. 
Since We are having this new way of life We had to face different systems trying to provide clear information about our situation and actual restrictions.
Sometimes the Government's pages contain too much details and it's hard to find out the exact information we need.

On this site I summed up all relevant information in a simple and clear way to make it understandable easily for You!
I also collected a few ideas How to keep your physical and mental health during the Pandemic.

### **Design Choices**

Nowadays all news are about the Coronavirus. It might be exhausting for many of us to see the potential danger everywhere associated with a strong yellow color.
In my design choices I am trying to avoid this visual anxiety and to create a harmonic ambience for the user.
I have used [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/) to come up with a harmonic color scheme.

#### Fonts

In order to find the exact fonts for my website, I visited [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/ "Google Fonts") to explore the options.
For the overall content I have decided to use the [Spartan](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Spartan?query=spartan#standard-styles "Google fonts: Spartan") font. In my opinion this font is easy to read and visually appealing.
For my headings I decided to go with a different font in order to make them stand out from the main content. The font I choosed for this, is the [Julius Sans One](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Julius+Sans+One?query=ju#standard-styles "Google Fonts: Julius Sans One") font.
This is a bit rounded uppercase font what matches with the overall font.

#### Icons

I have decided to implement icons, using the [Font Awesome library](https://fontawesome.com/ "Font Awesome"). I will make sure that the icons are styled according to the website. I will use some icons to make the website more visually appealing but not to overtake the content.

#### Colors

As mentioned before, I am trying to create a harmonic ambience for the user with natural but lively colors.

#### Structure

I have chosen to use [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) to create an overall structure for my website. 
Bootstrap provides various elements of CSS and Javascript which is very helpful to keep a good structure on your page. 
As Bootstrap is designed for mobile first, I will be certain that my website functions well on mobile.

## **Wireframes**

I have decided to use [Balsamic](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/) to create wireframes for my website. 
First I created a basic wireframe for desktop and later on for tablet and mobile. 
For my website I have decided to use a 4 pages structure that separate better the information.
The website will be easy to navigate by using the navigation bar.

You can find my wireframes below:

### [Tablet Wireframe](wireframes/tablet-wireframe.pdf)

### [Mobile Wireframe](wireframes/mobile-wireframe.pdf)

### **Design and Structure changes**

I've decided to make several changes I mentioned above. I decided to use a 1 scrolling page structure for my mentor's advice as it fits better for my ideas and for the actual web design trends.

I also evolved my design choices. The reason was that I saw the background image in an online background image library and I got a new idea to build my website as a galaxy guidance.
I think the background image suits for the topic as it seems a huge virus attacking the Earth. I tried not using too many colors for keep the contant easily readable and all 3 colors I used were picked from the background picture using DevTools.

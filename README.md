### **Design Choices**

Nowadays all news are about the Coronavirus. It might be exhausting for many of us to see the potential danger everywhere associated with a strong yellow color.
In my design choices I am trying to avoid this visual anxiety and to create a harmonic ambience for the user.
I have used [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) and [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/) to come up with a harmonic color scheme.

#### Fonts

#### Icons

#### Colors

As mentioned before, I am trying to create a harmonic ambience for the user with natural but lively colors.

#### Structure

I have chosen to use [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) to create an overall structure for my website. 
Bootstrap provides various elements of CSS and Javascript which is very helpful to keep a good structure on your page. 
As Bootstrap is designed for mobile first, I will be certain that my website functions well on mobile.

## **Wireframes**

I have decided to use [Balsamic](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/) to create wireframes for my website. 
First I created a basic wireframe for desktop and later on for tablet and mobile. 
For my website I have decided to use a 5 paged structure that provides a well organiyed output.
The website will be easy to navigate by using the navigation bar and the fixed clickable list on the left side.

You can find my wireframes below:

(Mokeup image)

## **Goal for this project** 

Our life has changed quite a lot due to Coronavirus was spreaded all around the world. 
Since We are having this new way of life We had to face different systems trying to provide clear information about our situation and actual restrictions.
Sometimes the Government's pages contain too much details and it's hard to find out the exact information we need.

On this site I summed up all relevant information in a simple and clear way to make it understandable easily for You!
I also collected a few ideas How to keep your physical and mental health during the Pandemic.
My goal is to help your everyday life so do not hesitate to make your questions through our form!

### **Design Choices**

Nowadays all news are about the Coronavirus. It might be exhausting for many of us to see the potential danger everywhere associated with a strong yellow color.
In my design choices I am trying to avoid this visual anxiety and to create a harmonic ambience for the user.
I have used [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/) to come up with a harmonic color scheme.

<a></a>
#### Fonts

In order to find the exact fonts for my website, I visited [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/ "Google Fonts") to explore the options.
For the overall content I have decided to use the [Spartan](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Spartan?query=spartan#standard-styles "Google fonts: Spartan") font. In my opinion this font is easy to read and visually appealing.
For my headings I decided to go with a different font in order to make them stand out from the main content. The font I choosed for this, is the [Julius Sans One](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Julius+Sans+One?query=ju#standard-styles "Google Fonts: Julius Sans One") font.
This is a bit rounded uppercase font what matches with the overall font.

#### Icons

I have decided to implement icons, using the [Font Awesome library](https://fontawesome.com/ "Font Awesome"). I will make sure that the icons are styled according to the website. I will use some icons to make the website more visually appealing but not to overtake the content.

#### Colors

As mentioned before, I am trying to create a harmonic ambience for the user with natural but lively colors.

#### Structure

I have chosen to use [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) to create an overall structure for my website. 
Bootstrap provides various elements of CSS and Javascript which is very helpful to keep a good structure on your page. 
As Bootstrap is designed for mobile first, I will be certain that my website functions well on mobile.

## **Wireframes**

I have decided to use [Balsamic](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/) to create wireframes for my website. 
First I created a basic wireframe for desktop and later on for tablet and mobile. 
For my website I have decided to use a 4 pages structure that separate better the information.
The website will be easy to navigate by using the navigation bar.

You can find my wireframes below:

### [Tablet Wireframe](wireframes/tablet-wireframe.pdf)

### [Mobile Wireframe](wireframes/mobile-wireframe.pdf)

### **Design and Structure changes**

I've decided to make several changes I mentioned above. I decided to use a 1 scrolling page structure for my mentor's advice as it fits better for my ideas and for the actual web design trends.

I also evolved my design choices. The reason was that I saw the background image in an online background image library and I got a new idea to build my website as a galaxy guidance.
I think the background image suits for the topic as it seems a huge virus attacking the Earth. I tried not using too many colors for keep the contant easily readable and all 3 colors I used were picked from the background picture using DevTools.

## **Features**

<a></a>
### **Existing Features**

#### Navigation

For the menu I have used Bootstrap to create a responsive navigation bar.
My goal was keeping it simple with using only a few menu options.
When hovering on the menu items its underline to make it visually appealing. 

#### Background

I decided to use one amazing background instead of implementing many smaller pictures.
I find this background picture shows our situation perfectly as the planet is facing with Pandemic.
It doesn't cause anxiety or include a color scheme used for calling people's attention for the danger.

#### Website content

For the content I've used Bootstrap grid to make a responsive structure for any devices.
I created a narrower column for the content and gave it a sarker layer to make it readable while the user can enjoy the background.
On mobile and tablet the content fill up the whole screen having the darker layout behind because there is no space enough to show parts only about the background.

For tablets and bigger screens I've used a very similar structure of content. I grouped the general information into 5 parts in 2 rows. 3 parts in the first row and 2 parts in the second row.
Using the same layout structure with icons for these 5 items shows well the grouping. On mobile device all of them shows up one after another.

The restrictions part I devided into 2 parts. The general restrictions for people who are living or staying in Ireland and rules for people travelling into Irelaand.
I choosed to put them one below the other to give some breathe to the content.

For the prevention I have decided to use bigger icons to demonstrate the prevention actions better and to make the content diverse. These icons are placed beside each other for tablet and bigger screens but on mobile it shows up as a 2x2 square grid.

The physical and mental health are two important question in this topic and it has to be practised together in a balanced way to achieve success so I put balance symbol between them and placed it the middle for tablet and bigger screens.
On mobile it shows up as a divider image. I provided the help lines information below them to end this section and make this information visible enough.

I decided to implement a Bootstrap form in the end to provide an option to make any questions about the topic and sending it. For mobile devices and tablets it is in the very end of the webpage but on larger screens its sharing the row with the vaccination information as both don't need that much space.

Generally I was about to write a simple and clear code with not using complicated solutions for simple things. I tried to resolve most of the issues with Bootstrap classes and using CSS only for making the components visually fitting to my idea and making my website unique.

## **Testing**

### Navigation bar

* **Plan**    
I want to include a navigation bar which will be fixed on top, including the title on the left side and the menu options on the right.
Whenever clicked on one of the navigation links, it should take the user to the appropriate part of the page.
To be more handy for mobile and for tablet the menu options groups together into a droppdown menu.

* **Implementation**   
I used Bootstrap to implement the navigation bar. This helps to give an overall structure and lay out to the navbar. 
I have used CSS to overwrite the default settings and to make the navbar suitable for the webpage's design. 

* **Test**    
To test the navigation bar, I have click all the links to make sure it works properly and checked if the dropdown menu is working on mobile and tablet devices.
I also tried if it is working in different browsers.

* **Result**    
The navigation bar shows nicely like expected on all browsers and devices. 
All the links work fine taking the user to the right section. 

* **Verdict**    
The test has passed all the criteria and works like planned.
